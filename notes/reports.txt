Model 1: Logistic Regression
features: all
parameters: default
performance metric: recall, precision
train set score: 0.57, 0.74
cross validation score: 0.55, 0.72
note: under fitting


Model 2: Logistic Regression
features: ['pregnancies', 'glucose', 'blood_pressure', 'bmi', 'dpf', 'age']
parameters: {threshold = 0.3}
performance metric: recall, precision
train set score: 0.79, 0.60
cross validation score: 0.78, 0.60
note: under fitting


Model 2: Support Vector Classifier (selected model)
features: ['pregnancies', 'glucose', 'blood_pressure', 'bmi', 'dpf', 'age']
parameters: {kernel = "linear", threshold = 0.3}
performance metric: recall, precision
train set score: 0.80, 0.61
cross validation score: 0.80, 0.60
note: ideal


Performance on test set:
accuracy: 0.75                  (model has 75% effeciency to distinguish between diabetic and non-diabetic patient)
recall: 0.85                    (model was able to detect 85% of diabetic patients)
precision: 0.61                 (out of all positive patients, only 61% where actually having diabeties)


Note: model with higher recall than precision was preferred to reduce false negatives
      (patients that are having diabeties but were classified as non-diabetic),
      while maintaining precision.
